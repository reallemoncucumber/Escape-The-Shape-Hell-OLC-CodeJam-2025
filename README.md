# \## STORY

# 

# In the vast, gentle expanse of the geometric ether, little Bob, a shape of impeccable roundness, was snoozing soundly, drifting peacefully beside his dear old Mum. All was calm, all was bright.

# 

# That is, until a grumpy, pointy rotter came barging through with frightful manners, knocking right into Mum! It wasn't a great shove, mind you, just a bit of a nudge, but it was enough to set poor, sleeping Bob adrift.

# 

# When he awoke, the world was suddenly very big and Mum was nowhere to be seen. But Bob, with those amazing pink cheeks he has from his mother, didn't despair! He simply readied his trusty harpoon, gave his brilliant \*\*FindMUMmeter\*\* a confident tap, and set off on his grand adventure home.
